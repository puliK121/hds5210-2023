# Midterm Feedback
The midterm feedback will be very similar to what you receive on a weekly basis for the homework, but more specific for each problem in this case.

## Final Score: 34/50


### Step 1: Priest Score Calculation
* **5pts** - Your code computed the correct probability and returned it
  * **(-3 pts) You did not complete the full calculation or converstion to a probability**
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **3pts** - You had at least three doctests in your docstring
  * **(-2 pts) You only had one test**

### Step 2: Find a Hospital
* **5pts** - Your code correctly fetched the correct hospital given the inputs using requests
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **(-3pts)** - No doctests

### Step 3: Get the Hospital Address
* **5pts** - Your code correctly fetched the JSON file, parsed it, and looked up the hospital
  * **(-1 pts) This needed to handle non uppercase hospital names**
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for
* **(-3pts)** - No doctests


### Step 4: Process List of Patients
* **10pts** - Your code correctly fetched the psv file, looped through it, and ran your other functions
  * **(-3 pts) You didn't compute the risk, hospital, or address in this loop**
* **2pts** - You had a docstring that described what the function was for

### Step 5: Compare Results
* **5pts** - Your code looped through all the results and compared them to the provided key
  * **(-3 pts) It's tough to know what's going on.  It says "successful" no matter what!**

### Extra Credit
* Up to 15 pts based on correctness and quality of the extra credit step
* **(+2 pts) You made an attempt, but had many errors and didn't demonstrate it**

### Coding Best Practices:
**3 pts** - Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?
* Good variable names?
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
