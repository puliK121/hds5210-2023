**(-1) Creating a function called merge_asthma_dataset that can be used genericaly really doesn't make sense. Just use the pandas function.**

**(-1) It looks to me that your merge of asthma and asthma_current didn't return any matches. Did you investigate that?  I don't see any comments on why this happened.**

**Overall you did a good job.  Just pay more attention to the details and share SPECIFIC insights, not just generic responses.**
